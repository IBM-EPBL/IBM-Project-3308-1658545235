----------It is basic smart home model----------

This smart home model invloves the usage of ultrasonic sensor which is used to calculate the
distance of the interfering object within the ultrasonic sensor range.

So,this ultrasonic sensor is interfaced with arduino UNO to monitor the object
interfering into the stipulated range(in this case -->smart home ) and turns on the lights 
automatically (which is shown by a simple light bulb)

The ultrasonic sensor uses a simple mechanism where the object reflects the waves and through which
the distance can be calculated by using simple basic formula(distance=speed * time).

Here threshold value for ultrasonic sensor is fixed to be 200 cm.
