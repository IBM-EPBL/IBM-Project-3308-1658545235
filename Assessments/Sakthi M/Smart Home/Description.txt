It's a Smart home automation system which includes the following feature,

Here the bulb glows if motion is detected and only if the brightness of the room is low

If the brightness of the room is more, and even if motion is detected, the bulb does not glows

I have coded to make the bulb glow for 10 seconds and after 10 seconds ,it switches off automatically

I have used PIR sensor for motion detection 

To check the brightness of the room, I have used Photoresistor
