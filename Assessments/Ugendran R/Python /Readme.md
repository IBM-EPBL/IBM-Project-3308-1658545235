# Python Assignment:
  - Sensor vales based on Random Python Function.
  - Threshold is used to control the Alert.


## Technologies Used:
          ->Python IDLE
          ->SimpleAudio
          ->Random Package.
          
### Random Function based sensor values:
          A Random Python Function is used to serve the sensor value. A static threshold is fixed, Sensor value greater than which will trigger a alert sound and a Message.
