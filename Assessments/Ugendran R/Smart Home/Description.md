          ->Buzzer
          ->LED
          
IOT Based Lighting:
          IoT smart lights use wireless switches that eliminate any need to wire the light switches to fixtures. These lights are then connected to a network that monitors and controls them via cloud. They can also be controlled remotely or through smaller devices like mobile phones or tablets. Based on factors like occupancy of the room or place, external lighting levels or time of day, you can control the intensity of individual or groups of lights. The connected lighting system can help you gather a lot of data through its sensors which can tell you how well your building is using electricity.
          
          
Temperature Controlled Servo Motor: 
          The temperature sensor senses the temperature outside and updates it on the serial monitor. The Servo motor is connected to the pulse width modulation PIN 13. It controls the speed of the Motor with respect to the temperature outside. As the temperature increases, the speed of the motor increases.
